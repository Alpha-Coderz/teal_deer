Currently just hacking notebook. However, the notebook scrapes text from a directory of academic research pdf's, 
and then does LDA on it for prioritization of reading. Dataset for this run included just a handful of papers 
on chatbots from arxiv.
In process: Adding a text summarization feature to try to generate abstracts or short summaries for large blocks
of text (i.e., an abstract for the rest of a paper). So, not only could papers be prioritized, but could be
summarized as well.
Planned updates - See project tab as well:
   + Finish out OCR from PDF files part
   + Complete the text summarization portion
   + Clean up into python scripts with test suites
   + Experiment with other front-end usecases: i.e., a slackbot is currently underway (notebook to be added later). 
   + Add a CI framework into this repo.
   + Cartoon for a fun logo :-)
